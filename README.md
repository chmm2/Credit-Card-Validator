Not to steal Credit Card details!!!

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Add all the numbers in the odds postion from RIGHT to LEFT
2. Multply every number in the evens position by 2 from RIGHT to LEFT. Add all the products, if the product comes to be above 10 then add the two numbers 
for example :- 6*2 = 12 -----------> 1+2 = 3 (3 will be the number to add to the sum)
3. Add the odds place sum and the evens place sum
4. If the total sum ends up to be a multiple of 10 then VOILA!!!, you got yourself a Credit Card :)
